# Chapter 8 - Building a Messaging App

## About this chapter

As we have gone through almost all the topics needed to build a mobile hybrid app, we will be building one in this chapter. The application we are going to build is a messaging app named Ionic Chat. The app we have developed in Chapter 6, The Bookstore App, deals with integrating REST API, while the Ionic Chat app we are going to build in this chapter will be more concerned with integrating device features such as camera and Geolocation with Ionic as well as talking to a real-time data store such as Firebase.

We will be going through the following topics:

 * Getting an idea about Firebase and setting up a Firebase account
 * Understanding AngularFire
 * Understanding the application architecture
 * Scaffolding the Ionic app and building it
 * Installing the required plugins and integrating them with the Ionic App
 * Testing the app on the device
